Goal: Create a new Excel workbook from a pandas DataFrame where each sheet provides a value count summary for a specified categorical column.

---

1. Context & Input Data

I have a pandas DataFrame already loaded and prepared (filtered). The data is clean and ready for summarization.

2. Required Column List

The following list contains the names of the categorical columns for which I need a separate summary sheet:

3. Output Specification

- Output File: The final result must be a single Excel file named Enq_TCD_{datetime}.xlsx.
- Writer: Use pandas.ExcelWriter with the xlsxwriter engine.
- Sheets (Pages): The Excel file must contain one separate sheet for *each* column in the Required Column List.
- Sheet Naming: Each sheet must be named after the column it summarizes (e.g., a sheet summarizing the 'sector' column should be named 'sector').
- Sheet Content:
    - For each column, calculate the value counts (the frequency of each unique value) value_counts() function already exist in pandas.
    - The resulting summary table on each sheet must have two columns: The unique value and its count.
    - The index of the resulting value counts Series MUST NOT be written to the Excel sheet.

4. Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Initialize a pandas.ExcelWriter instance targeting the file name Data_Summary.xlsx using the xlsxwriter engine.
2. Iterate through the list of required column names.
3. For each column:
    a. Calculate the value counts of that column in the DataFrame (df). Convert the result to a DataFrame.
    b. Use the to_excel() method to write the resulting summary to the ExcelWriter object.
    c. Set the sheet_name argument in to_excel() to the current column name.
    d. Set the index argument in to_excel() to False.
4. Save/Close the ExcelWriter object to generate the final Excel file.

5. Code Requirements

Provide the full, executable Python code block. Include a small, simple placeholder DataFrame setup *before* the main logic to ensure the code is runnable and demonstrates the process.
